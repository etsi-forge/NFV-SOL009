        7.5.5.3.1-2 for URI query parameters, request and response data

        the same callbackURI and the same filter can result in performance
        degradation and will provide duplicates of notifications to the API
        consumer, and might make sense only in very rare use cases.
        Consequently, the NFV-MANO functional entity may either allow creating a
        new "Individual subscription" resource if another "Individual
        subscription" resource with the same filter and callbackUri already
        exists (in which case it shall return the "201 Created" response code),
        or may decide to not create a duplicate "Individual subscription"
        resource (in which case it shall return a "303 See Other" response code
        referencing the existing "Individual subscription" resource with the
        same filter and callbackUri).
