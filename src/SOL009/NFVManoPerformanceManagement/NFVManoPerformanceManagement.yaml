                    The reportingPeriod should be equal to or a multiple of the collectionPeriod. In the latter case,
                    the performance data for the collection periods within one reporting period are reported together.
        * NOTE 2:	In particular when choosing short collection and reporting periods, the number of PM jobs that can
                    be supported depends on the capability of the producing entity.
