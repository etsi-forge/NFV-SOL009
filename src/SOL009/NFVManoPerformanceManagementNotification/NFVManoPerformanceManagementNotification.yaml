    description: >
      This resource represents a notification endpoint for NFV-MANO performance management. 
      The API producer can use this resource to send notifications related to performance 
      management events to an API consumer, which has provided the URI of this
      resource during the PM jobor threshold creation process.
    post:
      description: >
        The POST method delivers a notification regarding a performance management event
        from the API producer to an API consumer. The API consumer shall have previously 
        created an " Individual PM job resource" or "Individual threshold resource". See clause 6.5.10.3.1.
