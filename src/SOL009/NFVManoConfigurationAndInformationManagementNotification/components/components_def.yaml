            Provisions:
              1)	For each "newEntry" in "newList" that has a corresponding "oldEntry" in "oldList", the values of
                    the sub-attributes of "oldEntry" shall be replaced by the value of the sub-attributes in the "newEntry".
              2)	If the "newEntry" in "newList" has no corresponding "oldEntry" in "oldList" (i.e. the "id" is
                    not found), the modification operation will fail as a whole and an error message shall be raised.
