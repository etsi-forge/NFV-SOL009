    ThresholdCrossedNotification:
      description: >
        This type represents a notification that is sent when a threshold has been crossed.

        NOTE:	The timing of sending this notification is determined by the capability of
        the producing entity to evaluate the threshold crossing condition.

        The notification shall be triggered by the NFV-MANO functional entity when
        a threshold has been crossed.
