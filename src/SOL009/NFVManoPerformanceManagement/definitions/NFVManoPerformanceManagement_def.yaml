            object(s). This attribute’s value shall contain the related "Measurement Name"
            values as defined in clause 8.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 031.
            At least one of the two attributes (performance metric or group) shall be present.

        performanceMetricGroup:
          description: >
            Group of performance metrics.
            A metric group is a pre-defined list of metrics, known to the producer that it
            can decompose to individual metrics. This attribute’s value shall contain the
            related "Measurement Group" values as defined in clause 8.4 of ETSI GS
            NFV-IFA 031.
            At least one of the two attributes (performance metric or group) shall be present.

            type: string
        collectionPeriod:
          description: >
            Specifies the periodicity at which the producer will collect performance
            information. The unit shall be seconds. See note 1 and note 2.
          type: integer
        reportingPeriod:
          description: >
            Specifies the periodicity at which the producer will report to the API consumer
            about performance information. The unit shall be seconds. See note 1 and note 2.
          type: integer
        reportingBoundary:
          description: >
            Identifies a time boundary after which the reporting will stop.
            The boundary shall allow a single reporting as well as periodic reporting up to
            the boundary.

    ThresholdCriteria:
      description: >
        This type represents criteria that define a threshold.
        * NOTE 1:	In the present document, simple thresholds are defined. The definition of additional threshold
                    types is left for future specification.
        * NOTE 2:	The hysteresis is defined to prevent storms of threshold crossing notifications.
                    When processing a request to create a threshold, implementations should enforce a suitable minimum
                    value for this attribute (e.g. override the value or reject the request).
      type: object

        performanceMetric:
          description: >
            Defines the performance metric associated with the threshold.
            This attribute’s value shall contain the related "Measurement Name" values
            as defined in clause 8.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 031
          type: string
        thresholdType:
          description: >
            Type of threshold. This attribute determines which other attributes are
            present in the data structure.
            Permitted values:
              - SIMPLE: Single-valued static threshold

            In the present document, simple thresholds are defined. The definition
            of additional threshold types is left for future specification.

          properties:
            thresholdValue:
              description: >
                The threshold value. Shall be represented as a floating point number.

            hysteresis:
              description: >
                The hysteresis of the threshold.
                Shall be represented as a non-negative floating point number.
                A notification with crossing direction "UP" will be generated if the
                measured value reaches or exceeds "thresholdValue" + "hysteresis".
                A notification with crossing direction "DOWN" will be generated if
                the measured value reaches or undercuts "thresholdValue" - "hysteresis".

                The hysteresis is defined to prevent storms of threshold crossing notifications.
                When processing a request to create a threshold, implementations should enforce
                a suitable minimum value for this attribute (e.g. override the value or reject
                the request).
