        NOTE: The present document version does not specify the support for "log compilation and reporting based
        on events" as specified in clause 6.6.2.2 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 031.

        * NOTE 1:	The minimumReportingPeriod is used to throttle possible flooding of reports by providing a lower
                    limit on the gap between two log availability notification to be emitted by the same logging job.
          NOTE 2:	More than one logCompilingCondition is possible to provide a combination of different conditions
                    for the compilation. This covers use cases when the compilation of the log can be based on, e.g.
                    a timer value and a size value, whichever first condition is met first. For instance, compile a
                    log every 3 600 seconds, or whenever during the 3 600 seconds period the log grows in
                    size to 1 000 000 bytes.
          NOTE 3:	The value is indicative, as the actual size of the compiled log files might not match the provided
                    compileBySizeValue due to possible deviations in the tracking of the size of the log data by the
                    API producer, and the size of individual logged data entries when these are collected.
