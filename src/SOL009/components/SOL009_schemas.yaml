    EventType:
      description: >
        The enumeration EventType represents those types of events that trigger
        an alarm.
        * COMMUNICATIONS_ALARM: An alarm of this type is associated with the
          procedure and/or process required conveying information from one point
          to another (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * PROCESSING_ERROR_ALARM: An alarm of this type is associated with a
          software or processing fault (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * ENVIRONMENTAL_ALARM: An alarm of this type is associated with a
          condition related to an enclosure in which the equipment resides
          (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * QOS_ALARM: An alarm of this type is associated with degradation in the
          quality of a service (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * EQUIPMENT_ALARM: An alarm of this type is associated with an equipment
          fault (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
      type: string
      enum:
        - COMMUNICATIONS_ALARM
        - PROCESSING_ERROR_ALARM
        - ENVIRONMENTAL_ALARM
        - QOS_ALARM
        - EQUIPMENT_ALARM

    PerceivedSeverityType:
      description: >
        Indicates the relative level of urgency for operator attention.
        * CRITICAL: The Critical severity level indicates that a service
          affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action
          is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a
          managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability needs
          to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * MAJOR: The Major severity level indicates that a service affecting
          condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
          Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
          degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
          capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * MINOR: The Minor severity level indicates the existence of a
          non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
          should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
          service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
          example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
          the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates the detection of a
          potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
          effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
          necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
          becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation
          X.733).
        * INDETERMINATE: The Indeterminate severity level indicates that the
          severity level cannot be determined (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
        * CLEARED: The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of one or
          more previously reported alarms. This alarm clears all alarms for this
          managed object that have the same Alarm type, Probable cause and
          Specific problems (if given) (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
