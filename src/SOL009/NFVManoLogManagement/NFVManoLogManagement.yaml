      compiling the logged data, collected via a logging job, into a file and creating the associated log report.
      As the result of successfully processing this request, a new "Individual log report" resource shall be created.
      Two modes of operation, synchronous or asynchronous, can take place depending on whether the NFV-MANO functional
      entity can compile the log data and create the log report immediately. In the synchronous case, which is
      indicated by responding with "201 Created", the resource shall be created before the "201 Created" response
      is returned. In the asynchronous case, which is indicated by responding with "202 Accepted", the resource may
      be created after the response is returned.
